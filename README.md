# Episode 04 - Talk is Cheap, show me the code!

## Coding Assignment:

- Build a `Food Ordering App`
  - Think of a `cool name` for your app
  - Build an `AppLayout`
  - Build a `Header Component` with Logo & Nav Items & Cart

# Episode 05 - Let's get Hooked!

## Theory:

- What is the `difference` between `Named export`, `Default export`, and `* as export`?
- What are `React Hooks`?
- Why do we need `useState Hook`?

## Code:

- `Clean up` your code.
- Create a `Folder Structure` for your app.
- Make `different files` for each Component.
- Create a `config file`.

# Episode 08 - Let's get Classy

## Theory Assignment:

- What is the `order of life cycle method calls` in `Class Based Components`?
- Why do we use `componentDidMount`?
- Why do we use `componentWillUnmount`? Show with `example`.

- (Research) Why `can't we have` the `callback function` of `useEffect async`?

## Coding Assignment:

- Create `Class Based` Component.
  - Create 2 `class-based child components`.
  - `Pass props` from `Parent to child`.
  - Create a `constructor`.
  - Create a `state variable` inside child.
  - Use `this.setState` to update it.
  - What if there are `multiple state variables`?
  - Write a `console.log` for each lifecycle method.
  - Play with the `console logs` to find out the `correct order of their execution`.
- Create `interval` inside `componentDidMount`?
  - Use `clearInterval` to `fix the issue` caused by the `interval`
